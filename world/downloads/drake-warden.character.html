I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer. I&#x27;m a hopeless romantic, always searching for that &#x27;special someone&#x27;</p><p><strong>Ideals:</strong> Sincerity. There&#x27;s no good in pretending to be something I&#x27;m not. (Neutral) Freedom. Tyrants must not be allowed to oppress the people. (Chaotic)</p><p><strong>Bonds:</strong> I protect those who cannot protect themselves. There is no one to protect me, so I am the change I want to see in the world. I carry around a dragon egg that I found in the lair of the creature I slew. I take care of it now and keep it safe. I never knew my human father and cared for my elven mother until she fell ill and died. I resent him for leaving.</p><p><strong>Flaws:</strong> I don&#x27;t take orders well. I&#x27;d rather eat my armor than admit when I&#x27;m wrong.</p><h3>Backstory</h3><p>Dragon Egg: Black, shimmering scales, fits in her lap</p><p>Defining Event: I stood alone against a terrible monster.</p><h3>Physical Description</h3><p><strong>Age:</strong> 27</p><p><strong>Dress:</strong> Brown cloak, black boots</p><p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Amber</p><p><strong>Hair:</strong> Weight</p><p><strong>Skin:</strong> Pale</p><p><strong>Height:</strong> 5&#x27;2&quot;</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 110lbs</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Pensive, quiet, observant</p><h2>Features</h2><div><h3>Rustic Hospitality</h3><p>Since you come from the ranks of the common folk, you fit in among them with ease. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other commoners, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will shield you from the law or anyone else searching for you, though they will not risk their lives for you.</p></div><div><h3>Ability Score Increase</h3><p>Your Charisma score increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.</p></div><div><h3>Age</h3><p>Half-elves age at much the same rate as humans, reaching adulthood at the age of 20. They live much longer than humans, however, often exceeding 180 years.</p></div><div><h3>Alignment</h3><p>Half-elves share the chaotic bent of their elven heritage. They both value personal freedom and creative expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for followers. They chafe at rules, resent others&#x27; demands, and sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable. They are good and evil in equal numbers, a trait they share with their human parents.</p></div><div><h3>Size</h3><p>Half-elves are more or less the same size as humans, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.</p></div><div><h3>Speed</h3><p>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p></div><div><h3>Darkvision</h3><p>Thanks to your elven heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can&#x27;t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p></div><div><h3>Fey Ancestry</h3><p>You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can&#x27;t put you to sleep.</p></div><div><h3>Languages</h3><p>You can read, speak, and write Common, Elven, and one language of your choice.</p></div><div><h3>Half-Elf Versatility. - Skill Versatility (General)</h3><p>You gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.</p></div><div><h3>Favored Foe (Optional)</h3><p>This 1st-level feature replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don&#x27;t qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p><p>When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell).</p><p>The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you increase that damage by 1d4.</p><p>You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>This feature&#x27;s extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.</p></div><div><h3>Deft Explorer (Optional)</h3><p>This 1st-level feature replaces the Natural Explorer feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don&#x27;t qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p><p>You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.</p><p><strong>Canny (1st Level)</strong></p><p>Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using the chosen skill.</p><p>You can also speak, read, and write 2 additional languages of your choice.</p><p><strong>Roving (6th Level)</strong></p><p>Your walking speed increases by 5, and you gain a climbing speed and a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.</p><p><strong>Tireless (10th Level)</strong></p><p>As an action, you can give yourself a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 temporary hit point). You can use this action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p>In addition, whenever you finish a short rest, your exhaustion level, if any, is decreased by 1.</p></div><div><h3>Fighting Style</h3><p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can&#x27;t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p><p><strong>Two-Weapon Fighting</strong></p><p>When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.</p></div><div><h3>Spellcasting</h3><p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.</p><p><strong>Spell Slots</strong></p><p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell&#x27;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p><p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Animal Friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Animal Friendship using either slot.</p><p><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</strong></p><p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong></p><p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p><p>Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p><p>Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p></div><div><h3>Primal Awareness (Optional)</h3><p>This 3rd-level feature replaces the Primeval Awareness feature. You gain no benefit from the replaced feature and don&#x27;t qualify for anything in the game that requires it.</p><p>You can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don&#x27;t already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don&#x27;t count against the number of ranger spells you know.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Ranger Level</th><th scope="col">Spell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Speak with Animals</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Beast Sense</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Speak with Plants</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>Locate Creature</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Commune with Nature</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can&#x27;t do so again until you finish a long rest.</p></div><div><h3>Ranger Conclave</h3><p>At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Conclave</th><th scope="col">Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Beast Master</td><td>Player&#x27;s Handbook</td></tr><tr><td>Fey Wanderer</td><td>Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything</td></tr><tr><td>Gloom Stalker</td><td>Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything</td></tr><tr><td>Horizon Walker</td><td>Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything</td></tr><tr><td>Hunter</td><td>Player&#x27;s Handbook</td></tr><tr><td>Monster Slayer</td><td>Xanathar&#x27;s Guide to Everything</td></tr><tr><td>Swarm Keeper</td><td>Tasha&#x27;s Cauldron of Everything</td></tr><tr><td>Drakewarden</td><td>Fizban&#x27;s Treasury of Dragons</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2>Spellcasting</h2><p><strong>Spell Slots:</strong> 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</p><h3>Spell List - Ranger</h3><p><strong>Ability:</strong> wis</p><p><strong>Mod:</strong> 5</p><p><strong>Save DC:</strong> 13</p><p><strong>Cantrips:</strong> Thaumaturgy</p><p><strong>1st:</strong> Absorb Elements, Cure Wounds, *Speak with Animals, Zephyr Strike</p><p><strong>2nd:</strong> </p><p><strong>3rd:</strong> </p><p><strong>4th:</strong> </p><p><strong>5th:</strong> </p><p><strong>6th:</strong> </p><p><strong>7th:</strong> </p><p><strong>8th:</strong> </p><p><strong>9th:</strong> </p><h2>Inventory</h2><table><thead><tr><th scope="col">Name</th><th scope="col">Total</th><th scope="col">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Leather Armor</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Short Sword</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Explorer&#x27;s Pack</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Long Bow</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Quiver</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Arrows</td><td>20</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Iron Pot</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cook&#x27;s Utensils</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Common Clothes</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>GP</td><td>10</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Drake Companion</h1><img class="havok-design-system-token" src="../tokens/silver-dragon-token.png"/><div class="havok-design-system-half-column"><div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>+3</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">16</p><p>Strength</p><p>-</p></div><div><p>[] +3 Athletics</p></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>+1</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">12</p><p>Dexterity</p><p>*</p></div><div><p>[] +1 Acrobatics</p><p>[] +1 Stealth</p><p>[] +1 Sleight Of Hand</p></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>+2</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">15</p><p>Constitution</p><p>-</p></div><div></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>-1</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">8</p><p>Intelligence</p><p>-</p></div><div><p>[] -1 Arcana</p><p>[] -1 History</p><p>[] -1 Investigation</p><p>[] -1 Nature</p><p>[] -1 Religion</p></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>+2</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">14</p><p>Wisdom</p><p>*</p></div><div><p>[] +2 Animal Handling</p><p>[] +2 Insight</p><p>[] +2 Medicine</p><p>[] +2 Perception</p><p>[] +2 Survival</p></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score-container"><div class="havok-design-system-ability-score"><p>-1</p><p class="havok-design-system-ability-score-score">8</p><p>Charisma</p><p>-</p></div><div><p>[] -1 Deception</p><p>[] -1 Intimidation</p><p>[] -1 Performance</p><p>[] -1 Persuasion</p></div></div></div><div class="havok-design-system-key-value-container"><p><strong>Proficiency Bonus:</strong> 2</p><p><strong>CR:</strong> none</p><p><strong>AC:</strong> 16</p><p><strong>HP:</strong> 20/20</p><p><strong>Temp HP:</strong> 0</p><p><strong>Type:</strong> dragon</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> small</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 Feet</p><p><strong>Condition Immunities:</strong> </p><p><strong>Condition Resistances:</strong> </p><p><strong>Condition Vulnerabilities:</strong> </p><p><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> cold</p><p><strong>Damage Resistances:</strong> </p><p><strong>Damage Vulnerabilities:</strong> </p><p><strong>Senses:</strong> Darkvision 60ft.</p><p><strong>Languages:</strong> draconic</p></div></div><h2>Features</h2><div><h3>Draconic Essence</h3><p>When you summon the drake, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
